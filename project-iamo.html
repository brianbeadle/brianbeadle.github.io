      <p>As the use of multidimensional indices to assess complex aspects like well-being becomes commonplace in welfare economics, debates persist regarding conceptualization and methodological approaches. Our paper addresses this by proposing the application of Bayesian item response theory (IRT) to model Amartya Sen's capability approach by treating the dimensions of well-being as latent traits. Emphasizing individuals' substantive freedoms and opportunities, the capability approach poses challenges in interpretation, measurement, and application. We employ a multidimensional graded response model within the Bayesian IRT framework, incorporating covariates such as age, gender, and location. Unlike conventional methods, Bayesian models provide results as probabilities, highlighting uncertainty and capturing the nuanced nature of individual well-being. This approach allows for a refined understanding of the likelihood of specific capabilities, aligning with the variability in individuals' abilities to convert resources into well-being, a key aspect of the capability approach. Utilizing longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a nationally representative household survey, we present findings at both the individual and regional levels. This study represents the first-ever attempt to apply the capability approach within an item response model to measure multidimensional well-being, offering a novel perspective on the assessment of individual freedoms and opportunities in the pursuit of well-being.</p>
